== RequestStubber

Allows you to stub a request by either delaying the request time,
returning a specific response code, or a combination of both.

Note that the RequestStubber module is only mixed-in in development mode.

=== Example

Delays the process time of the request, by n seconds.

  class UsersController
    def index
      # ...
    end

    # Any request send to :index will be delayed 2 seconds.
    delay :index, 2
  end

Returns the specified response code.

  class UsersController
    def index
      # ...
    end

    # Any request send to :index will return a 404 response code.
    respond :index, 404
  end
